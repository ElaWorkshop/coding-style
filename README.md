# TeaWhen Coding Style

## Commit Log

### Complete

Use full sentences (sentence case, including period). If the commit is issue related, add a prefix "[Verb #ID] " (don't forget the space). Use simple past tense or simple present tense.

**For example:**
```
[Fix #3] Migrated to AFNetworking 2.0.
```

**But not:**
```
migrate to AFNetworking 2.0
```

### Explicit

Use explicit description.

**For example:**
```
Fixed table view cell text overflow.
```

**But not:**
```
bug fix
```
